#Late Afternoon

This is an icon theme for linux systems using freedesktop's icon naming scheme, 
as well as GNOME/KDE specific names.

The icons are all scalable vector graphics (SVG). Application icons have a 
standard size of 48px, symbolic icons 16px and panel icons 24px. This means 
they are designed to be pixel perfect at that size.

The color palette used is the Echo icon palette coming with inkscape. Different 
colors are only used for icons which have a unique color identity.

Application icons are designed to be nearly square (very small corner radius) 
and relatively flat with a central shape identifying the application. The 
central shape has a "long shadow" as an eye catcher which points diagonally to 
the south-east corner.

#TODO

* Icons that should be made (by priority, important first)
  - Brightness & Lock (system-lock-screen)
  - Big trash icon
  - ...

* Reconstruct color palette from numix icons?
